# Reed-Solomon Error Detection and Correction Library
## Overview
This C++ library provides a Reed-Solomon error detection and correction implementation. Reed-Solomon codes are widely used for reliable data encoding, particularly in scenarios with potential data corruption or loss. The library includes encoding, decoding, and testing functionalities.

## Features
- Encoding: Generate Reed-Solomon codewords from input data.
- Decoding: Attempt to correct errors in received codewords.
- Testing: Evaluate the error correction capabilities through statistical tests.
